# Lynx Tailwind Playground 🚀

Welcome to the Lynx Tailwind Playground! This project serves as an interactive testing ground for exploring Tailwind CSS integration with Lynx, helping us build a stronger and more reliable styling ecosystem for the Lynx community.

## Project Goals

- 🎯 Explore and test Tailwind CSS functionality within the Lynx environment
- 🔍 Identify and document differences between standard Tailwind and `@lynx-js/tailwind-preset-canary`
- 📝 Create reproducible examples to help improve the Lynx Tailwind implementation
- 🤝 Contribute to the Lynx ecosystem by providing valuable feedback to maintainers

> **Note**: This project currently uses `@lynx-js/tailwind-preset-canary@0.0.2`. As we're in the early stages of Tailwind integration, you might notice some inconsistencies - this is expected and actually helps us improve! By documenting these differences, we can work together to enhance the Lynx Tailwind experience for everyone.
